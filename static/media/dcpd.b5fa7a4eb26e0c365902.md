# **3D Printing of Dicyclopentadiene**

## Background
As part of the Zachariah Page Research Group at the University of Texas at Austin, I was involved in projects that aim to expand the capabilities of polymers through unique manufacturing techniques, typically using light as a stimulus. My first project involved the creation and patterning of polydicyclopentadiene (PDCPD), an industrially tough and resilient polymer, through the use of DLP 3D printing and visible light.

## Resin System
The resin system used in this project was meant to utilize ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) in order to polymerize the monomer dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). ROMP is a chain growth polymerization, promoted by a ruthenium based Grubbs catalyst in order to polymerize cyclic olefins.

In order to activate the Grubbs catalyst used in this system in response to a light based stimulus, a photo initiator was used in conjunction with the Grubbs catalyst. The selected photoinitiator, 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPPT), was selected due to its sensitivity to 470 nm blue light.

To determine the ideal makeup of the resin system, we used a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques to maximize DCPD conversion to PDCPD in the shortest amount of time. By varying photoinitiator and catalyst concentration through multiple Design of Experiment (DOE)
 trials and verifying curing characteristics through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and photorheology, we were able to select an optimized system for use in 3D printing.

## 3D Printing

In order to create complex structures from this resin system, the use of DLP 3D printing was employed. This technology allows for fast and precise creation of structures without the use of external equipment such as molds. Unlike previous experimentation that was performed in the inert environment of a glovebox, the 3D printing environment was exposed to atmosphere. This resulted in the inhibition of the resin system, slowing down conversion speed and the ultimate conversion of the resin system.

Currently, this project is awaiting equipment capable of higher light intensity printing, to overcome the inhibition caused by oxygen.
